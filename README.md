# Grow a Garden Clicker

A small utility program that listens for keyboard shortcuts to automatically press the **E** key while Roblox is the active window.

## Features

- ‚å®Ô∏è **F3**: Toggles the auto-pressing of the **E** key on/off.
- ‚å®Ô∏è **F1**: Immediately exits the program.
- üïπÔ∏è Only works when the active window is **Roblox**, ensuring no interference with other applications.

## Use Case

This program is intended for use in Roblox games where repeatedly pressing **E** is required (e.g., interacting with objects or farming mechanics). It saves your fingers from unnecessary strain by automating the key press.

## How It Works

1. Launch the program.
2. It runs in the background and waits for hotkeys:
   - Press **F3** to start or stop the automation.
   - Press **F1** to quit the program.
3. When enabled and the active window is Roblox, the **E** key will be pressed in a loop.
